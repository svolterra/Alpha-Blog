## About ✨

---

The Alpha Blog was developed following Mashrur
Hossain's ["The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/)
with a few freestyle adjustments!  💃

Created using Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS, the Alpha Blog allows users to:
* Create new articles  ✏️
* Update existing articles 📝
* View all created articles 📖
* Delete articles if desired ✂️


***Ruby version: 5.2.6***
